OOPS concepts:
------------------
	OOP means Object Oriented Programming. There are four main concepts of OOPS. They are
1. Encapsulation :
	The data along with the methods that operate on the data are bundled together into a single unit called the class. This mechanism is called encapsulation.
In Selenium, In Page Object Model design pattern, we bundle the webElements of the page and the page action methods in a single class.
2. Abstraction :
	The process of displaying only the essential information and hiding the background implementation is called Abstraction. 
In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and Interfaces.
Some interfaces used in Selenium are WebDriver, WebElement, JavascriptExecutor, Wait, Alert, TakeScreenshot.
3. Inheritance :
	It is the mechanism where one class derives the property of another class. With Inheritance, we could reuse the fields and methods of the already existing class.
In java, inheritance is achieved through 'extends' keyword.
In Selenium, every class extends the base class where the driver is instantiated.
4. Polymorphism :
	Poly - many; morph - forms ; Polymorphism means the ability of the data to be processed in many forms. We can have one interface and have multiple implementations.
 There are two kinds of Polymorphism. They 
(i) Method overloading :
	It is called compile time polymorphism. The class has two or more methods with the same name but different parameters.
In Selenium, the moveToTarget(WebElement target), moveToTarget(WebElement target, int x-offset, int y-offset) is an exmaple.
(ii) Method overriding :
	When the sub class has the same method name, same return type and same parameters as that of the parent class method, it is called method overriding. 
It is also called as Run time polymorphism.
In Selenium, WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
In the abive example, we have achieved run-time polymorphism by upcasting.
